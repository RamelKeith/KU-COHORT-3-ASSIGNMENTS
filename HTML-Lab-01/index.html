    <h2>What is Dungeons & Dragons?</h2>
    <p>
        Dungeons & Dragons is a structured, yet open-ended role-playing game.
        It is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a tabletop.
        Typically, one player takes on the role of Dungeon Master (DM) while the others each control a single character, 
        representing an individual in a fictional setting. When working together as a group, the player characters (PCs)
        are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty
        which contributes to the success of the whole. During the course of play, each player directs the actions
        of their character and their interactions with other characters in the game. This activity is performed
        through the verbal impersonation of the characters by the players, while employing a variety of social and
        other useful cognitive skills, such as logic, basic mathematics and imagination. A game often continues
        over a series of meetings to complete a single adventure, and longer into a series of related gaming adventures,
        called a "campaign". <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">D&D Offical Website</a>

    <h2>How To Play</h2>
    <p>
        The results of the party's choices and the overall story line for the game are determined by the DM according
        to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules. The DM selects and describes
        the various non-player characters (NPCs) that the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions
        occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions. Encounters often
        take the form of battles with "monsters" a generic term used in D&D to describe potentially hostile beings
        such as animals, aberrant beings, or mythical creatures. The game's extensive rules which cover diverse
        subjects such as social interactions, magic use, combat, and the effect of the environment on PCs
        help the DM to make these decisions. The DM may choose to deviate from the published rules or make up new
        ones if they feel it is necessary.
